        <h2>Skills and Certifications</h2>
        <ul>
			<li>Expert in reading Binary like it's my first language. I'm practically the Picasso of 0's and 1's.</li>

			<li>Advanced knowledge in Java. Not the island or the beverage, but I can have long conversations about both.</li>

			<li>Proficient bug exterminator in the software realm. Less reliable for actual bugs, unless you want them turned into extra code snippets.</li>

			<li>Expert PHP developer. Strangely, I'm not a Hypertext Preprocessor myself, just a humble developer.</li>

			<li>Savvy in SQL databases - I know, it's a very "select" skill, insert sarcasm here.</li>

			<li>Ruby on Rails - It's like a train ride, except the tracks are made of code and the train is more... virtual?</li>

			<li>JavaScript extraordinaire - Jack of all trades, master of this one.</li>

			<li>Typing at lightning speed with a record-breaking average of only two typos per manuscript!</li>
